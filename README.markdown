I'm still trying to decide on the right language, GUI toolkit, etc. to use. I'm even thinking of directly absorbing the original code into a stand-alone program (interoperable with the original, of course).

Right now I'm leaning toward Ruby + Gosu + GGLib and passing generated text files to the existing VBSG executable. Some other options include:

<dl>
<dt>Adobe AIR</dt>
<dt>Java</dt>
<dt>C/C++ and:</dt>
<dd>Win32 API (not very portable, though)</dd>
<dd>wxWindows (not likely)</dd>
<dd>SDL w/ some kind of SDL GUI lib</dd>
<dd>SDL w/ scratch-built interface stuff</dd>
</dl>
