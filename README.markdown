I'm still trying to decide on the right language, GUI toolkit, etc. to use and whether to call the existing VBSG executable, or to absorb the original code and make it stand-alone.

Right now I'm leaning toward Ruby + Gosu + GGLib and passing generated text files to VBSG. Some other options include (in rough order from more to less likely):

<dl>
<dt>C# (.NET/mono)</dt>
<dt>Adobe AIR</dt>
<dt>C/C++ and:</dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>plain Win32 API</dt>
<dt>SDL w/ some kind of SDL GUI lib</dt>
<dt>SDL w/ scratch-built interface stuff</dt>
<dt>wxWindows (not likely)</dt>
<dt>Java</dt>
</dl></dd>
</dl>
